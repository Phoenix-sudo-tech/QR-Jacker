ABOUT THE PROJECT:
QR-Jacker is a demonstration tool built for 
educational and cybersecurity research purposes.
It showcases how QR-based redirection and 
client-side data collection can function in 
controlled penetration testing or ethical hacking labs.

This tool is intended to help researchers and 
students understand how device info can be 
collected through browser interactions and how to 
protect systems from similar attacks in the wild.
